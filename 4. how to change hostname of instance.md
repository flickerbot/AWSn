Each EC2 instance has a hostname, which is a label assigned to the instance that identifies it on the network.

The hostname is used to identify the instance when it communicates with other instances or services in the network. For example, if you have a web application running on an EC2 instance, the hostname is used to identify the instance when it communicates with a load balancer that distributes traffic to multiple instances.
