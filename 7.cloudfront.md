 ## Cloud front 
> Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your 
> content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the request is routed to the edge location that 
> provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.

Basically cloud front stores our server files on edge location that is relative near as compared to remote server location so accessing the files reduces the latency time and user can access
the data in less time


we can create cloud front based on domain like ec2 ,s3 ,APIs etc 

### steps to launch cloudfront 

> define origin (url)
> name 
> if we are allowing public we need not to define policy but if we are allowing only restricted access we need to define policy 


 For s3 origin access control
> create control settings -- donot sign request 
> create cache policy -- define ttl ( time to live ) 
> create distribution 
> a policy will be generated copy that policy and paste it to S3 permissions -- policy 

basically the policy give only our cloudfront to access the objects of the bucket ! 


for ec2 we can skip these steps as no policy is needed there 



### other options in cloudfront 

Origin 
> we can define more than one entity here like if the origin is s3 than we can add other like ec2 or api etc 

Behaviors
> we can specify the path and redirect the cloud fornt to a particular origin 

like 
/images* --- path
origin   --- ec2 
anything starting with images in url will be redirected to ec2 origin 



/*.png 
anything ending with png can be redirected to a particular origin 



These path will be defined in the cloudfront url 

```
original domain name 
https://dg4arfa2pa7yk.cloudfront.net 

path specified 

https://dg4arfa2pa7yk.cloudfront.net/index.html  -- we define .html to be redirected for ec2 so this will open in ec2 only no matter if index.html is present on there 
origin like s3 or not 

https://dg4arfa2pa7yk.cloudfront.net/a.png 


```

Error pages 
> we can define custom error pages ny selecting the error code and defining the return path for the request to be shown 

Edit geographic restrictions
> we can define as per our needs where the cloudfront should be restricted and should not be accessed we can define country to be allowed or rejected 

> invalidations
that we want to remove from cache 
here if we redeploy the data on our server we need to clear everthing on cache from the edge loaction so we specify /* in invalidation path
