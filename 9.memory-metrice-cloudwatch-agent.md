CloudWatch Agent can send memory usage information every 60 seconds if you want. You just need to use your favorite editor to create the file /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json with the appropriate content. I will use nano for this. Of course, you can set the interval as needed.

> nano /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json


The file should contain:

```

{
   "metrics":{
      "metrics_collected":{
         "mem":{
            "measurement":[
               "mem_used_percent"
            ],
            "metrics_collection_interval":60
         }
      },
      "append_dimensions": {
        "InstanceId": "${aws:InstanceId}"
      }
   }
}

```


Now you just need to start CloudWatch Agent with the command below and thatâ€™s it.

> sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json -s
