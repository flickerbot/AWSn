Elastic Load balancer


## Load balancing is the method of distributing network traffic equally across a pool of resources that support an application


> Load balancing is like the work done by a manager in a restaurant. Consider a restaurant with five waiters. If customers were allowed to choose their waiters, one or two waiters could be
> overloaded with work while the others are idle. To avoid this scenario, the restaurant manager assigns customers to the specific waiters who are best suited to serve them.


## classic load balancer 
not used kinda outdated sends traffic directly to ec2 instance 

## application load balancer 
An Application Load Balancer makes routing decisions at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS), supports path-based routing, and can route requests to one or more ports on each container instance in your cluster
we can specify path and queries to redirect to a particular target group 

> Create target group
> goto load balancer > listner 
> View edit rule 
> goAdd rules and specify the route 



## network load balancer 
based on network layer used fr redirecting to ports etc ..
